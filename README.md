As part of this project, I have developed a simple login app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# loginapp
This is a sample login app. This repo is used as a starter for a very basic HTML web application using no front-end frameworks.

# Success Scenario

When user enters correct username and password, console message "You have logged in successfully!" is displayed.

username: **roopikas**


password: **Welcome1!**

# Failure Scenario

When user enters incorrect username and password, error message "Login failed due to incorrect username and password" is displayed.

# Run App

To check the app in action, clone the Github Repo to local system and open login.html in any browser
